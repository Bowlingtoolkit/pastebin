<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ✎ &nbsp;both his parents are koreans but were born and brought up in australia, hence giving their children a </div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; second name, which he did not quite adore. he thought that it was kind of useless having to have two names </div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when you only need one to be called out to</div></li>
<li class="li2"><div class="de2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ✎ &nbsp;his rule model is bts' suga. he adores him for his attitude towards almost everyone, as his attitude is </div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; also quite similar and would try to be similar as well. his role model according to career would be exo's </div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; kai as his dancing skills and charisma both excite him</div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ✎ &nbsp;he is a vegan ( unlike his sister who is a chicken lover ). he started becoming a vegan when he had first </div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; joined mangolia. he would even try to persuade others to join his vegan life</div></li>
<li class="li2"><div class="de2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ✎ &nbsp;he is an A grade student and always managed to top all his classes like a prO.</div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ✎ &nbsp;he is atychiphobic which is the fear of failing. he has literally always managed to do everything right </div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and his way, if he messes up even the slightest bit out of line, his perfectionist nature would have him </div></li>

<li class="li1"><div class="de1">✎ &nbsp;SERIOUS, despite his sister, chaeryu being the most sweetest and friendliest person, jaehan on the other hand is </div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;just plain serious and leans towards the introverted side. he usually helps in making the choreography </div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and is hella serious when it comes to it. like not only when choreography but like generally he's just </div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;too serious. jaehan tends to get angry really fast too and the only person who can calm him down is </div></li>
<li class="li2"><div class="de2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;chaeryu and that's why the members like having her around just in case she needs to calm him down. he is </div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;one of the best dancers in his school as well and one of the reasons for his seriousness is probably </div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;because he is afraid that he might drop the level of respect he gets and according to him, his ego is </div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;very important. well, not as important as his sister though.</div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">✎ &nbsp;COLD, &nbsp; &nbsp;honestly not even his fault. He just doesn't enjoy being around people too much and loves spending time </div></li>
<li class="li2"><div class="de2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;by himself. jaehan is not really able to open up to people as easily as his sister and so his sister </div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;teaches him some important friendly manners and helps him a lot, he's very thankful as well. is not like </div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;he's afraid or hates people, he either just doesn't like spending time with that person or he finds </div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;trouble opening up to that person. despite him being cold and quite reserved at times, people, mostly the </div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;girls love love his diMpLes !! that is probably one of the many reasons he's quite famous round school, </div></li>
<li class="li2"><div class="de2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;other than being a good dancer of course. he would even excuse himself to cry about it to his sister.</div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">✎ &nbsp;HARSH, &nbsp; if he doesn't like you, jaehan would literally just say it to your face or if your outfit were pretty bad </div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;he would tell it directly to you, not giving a shit about anything. he doesn't tend to be rude, it just </div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;slips out of his mouth. he also is quite pessimistic and most of the time would get really annoying with </div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;his kind of disturbing and annoying negative commentary. this is probably one of the reason he doesn't </div></li>
<li class="li2"><div class="de2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;really have waaaay too many friends cause he can be too open minded and harsh at times.</div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">✎ &nbsp;OCD, &nbsp; &nbsp; jaehan has Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) and it really gets on his nerves when people make a mess </div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;or touch stuff and then put it back in the wrong place, especially if it's his things. chaeryu can get </div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;really messy and clumsy at times and that is probably one of the reasons jaehan doesn't like her. he </div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;hates people who are messy or dirty would keep his distance far from them. jaehan would always have his </div></li>

        ✎  both his parents are koreans but were born and brought up in australia, hence giving their children a 
            second name, which he did not quite adore. he thought that it was kind of useless having to have two names 
            when you only need one to be called out to
        ✎  his rule model is bts' suga. he adores him for his attitude towards almost everyone, as his attitude is 
            also quite similar and would try to be similar as well. his role model according to career would be exo's 
            kai as his dancing skills and charisma both excite him
        ✎  he is a vegan ( unlike his sister who is a chicken lover ). he started becoming a vegan when he had first 
            joined mangolia. he would even try to persuade others to join his vegan life
        ✎  he is an A grade student and always managed to top all his classes like a prO.
        ✎  he is atychiphobic which is the fear of failing. he has literally always managed to do everything right 
            and his way, if he messes up even the slightest bit out of line, his perfectionist nature would have him 
            dead
 
personality
✎  SERIOUS, despite his sister, chaeryu being the most sweetest and friendliest person, jaehan on the other hand is 
             just plain serious and leans towards the introverted side. he usually helps in making the choreography 
             and is hella serious when it comes to it. like not only when choreography but like generally he's just 
             too serious. jaehan tends to get angry really fast too and the only person who can calm him down is 
             chaeryu and that's why the members like having her around just in case she needs to calm him down. he is 
             one of the best dancers in his school as well and one of the reasons for his seriousness is probably 
             because he is afraid that he might drop the level of respect he gets and according to him, his ego is 
             very important. well, not as important as his sister though.
✎  COLD,    honestly not even his fault. He just doesn't enjoy being around people too much and loves spending time 
             by himself. jaehan is not really able to open up to people as easily as his sister and so his sister 
             teaches him some important friendly manners and helps him a lot, he's very thankful as well. is not like 
             he's afraid or hates people, he either just doesn't like spending time with that person or he finds 
             trouble opening up to that person. despite him being cold and quite reserved at times, people, mostly the 
             girls love love his diMpLes !! that is probably one of the many reasons he's quite famous round school, 
             other than being a good dancer of course. he would even excuse himself to cry about it to his sister.
✎  HARSH,   if he doesn't like you, jaehan would literally just say it to your face or if your outfit were pretty bad 
             he would tell it directly to you, not giving a shit about anything. he doesn't tend to be rude, it just 
             slips out of his mouth. he also is quite pessimistic and most of the time would get really annoying with 
             his kind of disturbing and annoying negative commentary. this is probably one of the reason he doesn't 
             really have waaaay too many friends cause he can be too open minded and harsh at times.
✎  OCD,     jaehan has Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) and it really gets on his nerves when people make a mess 
             or touch stuff and then put it back in the wrong place, especially if it's his things. chaeryu can get 
             really messy and clumsy at times and that is probably one of the reasons jaehan doesn't like her. he 
             hates people who are messy or dirty would keep his distance far from them. jaehan would always have his 
             chores done on time and actually enjoys doing them cause he knows that at least his surrounding would 
             stay clean. damn, his roommate would be lucky.
