I have a very serious & critical problem to bring to the table today for you, Anon. Please read this.

I believe I may have been somehow transported into another parallel Universe or dimension, due to being a sinful Christian in my youth, where the books 1984 & Fahrenheit 9/11 were only symbolic reminders of how bad our society could turn out if we let it. Where terrorism won, and changed our society as we know it to everything we despised.

Clicking on the wrong link can land you in prison for 15 years. Reading the wrong book will land you 15 years in prison.

UK just passed a law today called the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019 where clicking on a link deemed to be 'terrorist propaganda' lands you 15 years in prison. The word terrorism is subjective & the word propaganda is subjective, the word 'terrorism' was used to justify everything from total & complete surveillance of everyone through their phones camera, microphone, & web browser to wars against Iraq despite the hijackers being from Saudi Arabia.

But say a trusted flagger on Youtube in the UK is checking a 'propaganda' video on Youtube - they won't get sent to prison - the common man will. These hypocritical cowards sold us out for cheaper than sheep.

We are no longer a free country.

You know what will cause more terrorism? Laws like these, mark my words.

I call on everyone who wants freedom & liberty for peaceful protest against this act.

Mark my words, they will call this post terrorist propaganda too.

What do I do? How do I go back?

May God have mercy on us!
