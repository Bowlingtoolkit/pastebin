<div class="content_text">Last updated: April 18, 2018<br /><br />Thank you for using Pastebin! We're happy you're here. Please read this Terms of Service agreement carefully before accessing or using Pastebin. Because it is such an important contract between us and our users, we have tried to make it as clear as possible. For your convenience, we have presented these terms in a short non-binding summary followed by the full legal terms.</div>
<div class="content_sub_title">A. Definitions</div>
<div class="content_text">
	<div id="notice"><b>Short version:</b> <i>We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.</i></div>
	1. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the Pastebin <a href="doc_privacy_statement.html">Privacy Statement</a>) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. 
	<br />
	2. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by Pastebin.
	<br />
	3. The “Website” refers to Pastebin’s website located at Pastebin.com, and all content, services, and products provided by Pastebin at or through the Website. It also refers to Pastebin-owned subdomains of Pastebin.com
	<br />
	4. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the account; or that directs the use of the account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. 
	<br />
	5. “Pastebin,” “We,” and “Us” refer to Pastebin.com, as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
	<br />
	6. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
</div>
<div class="content_sub_title">B. Account Terms</div>
<div class="content_text">
	<div id="notice"><b>Short version:</b> <i>A human must create your account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free account. You alone are responsible for your account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your account. You are responsible for keeping your account secure.</i></div>
	<b>1. Required Information</b>
	<br />
	You must provide a valid email address, password &amp; user name in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a paid account, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.
	<br /><br />
	<b>2. Account Requirements</b>
	<br />
	We have a few simple rules for accounts on Pastebin's Service.
	<br /><br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#9654;</b> You must be a human to create an account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#9654;</b> A machine account is an account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free personal account.
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#9654;</b> One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#9654;</b> You must be age 13 or older. Pastebin does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User’s account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
	<br /><br />
	<b>3. User Account Security</b>
	<br />
	You are responsible for keeping your account secure while you use our Service. 
	<br /><br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#9654;</b> You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account.
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#9654;</b> You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. Pastebin cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#9654;</b> You will promptly notify Pastebin if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your account, including any unauthorized use of your password or account.
</div>
<div class="content_sub_title">C. Acceptable Use</div>
<div class="content_text">
	<div id="notice"><b>Short version:</b> <i>While using the service, you must follow this Acceptable Use Policy, which includes some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.</i></div>
	<b>1. Compliance with Laws and Regulations</b>
	<br />
	Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.
	<br /><br />
	<b>2. Content Restrictions</b>
	<br />
	<div id="error">You agree that you will not under any circumstances upload, post, host, or transmit any content that:
		<br /><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#9654;</b> is unlawful or promotes unlawful activities;
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#9654;</b> is or contains sexually obscene content;
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#9654;</b> is libelous, defamatory, or fraudulent;
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#9654;</b> is discriminatory or abusive toward any individual or group;
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#9654;</b> contains or installs any active malware or exploits, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of a command and control system); or
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#9654;</b> infringes on any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other rights.
	</div>
	<br /><br />
	<b>3. Conduct Restrictions</b>
	<br />
	While using Pastebin, you agree that you will not under any circumstances:
	<br /><br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#9654;</b> harass, abuse, threaten, or incite violence towards any individual or group, including Pastebin employees, officers, and agents, or other Pastebin Users;
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#9654;</b> use our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any other form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers, such as get-rich-quick schemes;
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#9654;</b> attempt to disrupt or tamper with Pastebin's servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place undue burden on Pastebin's servers through automated means, or to access Pastebin's Service in ways that exceed your authorization (other than those authorized by the Pastebin Bug Bounty program);
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#9654;</b> impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false association with Pastebin, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site's purpose; or
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#9654;</b> violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person's personal information without consent.
	<br /><br />
	<b>4. Services Usage Limits</b>
	<br />
	You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without Pastebin's express written permission.
	<br /><br />
	<b>5. Scraping</b>
	<br />
	Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the collection of information through Pastebin's API. You may scrape the website for the following reasons:
	<br /><br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#9654;</b> Researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from Pastebin for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are open access.
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#9654;</b> Archivists may scrape Pastebin for public data for archival purposes.
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#9654;</b> You may not scrape Pastebin for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling Pastebin users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.
	<br /><br />
	<b>If you scrape our site too aggressively we will block your IP.</b> To prevent this from happening we have created a <a href="doc_scraping_api.html">scraping API</a>. We required a Pastebin PRO account to access the scraping API.
	<br /><br />
	All use of Pastebin data gathered through scraping must comply with the Pastebin <a href="doc_privacy_statement.html">Privacy Statement</a>.
	<br /><br />
	<b>6. Privacy</b>
	<br />
	Misuse of Pastebin Users' Personal Information is prohibited.
	<br /><br />
	Any person, entity, or service collecting data from Pastebin must comply with the Pastebin Privacy Statement, particularly in regards to the collection of our Users' Personal Information (as defined in the Pastebin Privacy Statement). If you collect any Pastebin User's Personal Information from Pastebin, you agree that you will only use the Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from Pastebin, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from Pastebin or Pastebin Users.
	<br /><br />
	<b>7. Excessive Bandwidth Use</b>
	<br />
	If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to other Pastebin customers, we reserve the right to suspend your account or throttle your file hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.
	<br /><br />
	<b>8. User Protection</b>
	<br />
	You agree not to engage in activity that significantly harms our Users. We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting our Users as a whole.
</div>
<div class="content_sub_title">D. User-Generated Content</div>
<div class="content_text">
	<div id="notice"><b>Short version:</b> <i>You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close accounts if we need to.</i></div>
	<b>1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content</b>
	<br />
	You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.
	<br /><br />
	<b>2. Pastebin May Remove Content</b>
	<br />
	We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any Pastebin terms or policies.
	<br /><br />
	<b>3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants</b>
	<br />
	You retain ownership of and responsibility for Content you create or own ("Your Content"). If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.
	<br /><br />
	<b>4. License Grant to Us</b>
	<br />
	We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.
	<br /><br />
	<b>5. License Grant to Other Users</b>
	<br />
	Any User-Generated Content you post publicly may be viewed by others. By setting your pastes to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view your pastes.
	<br /><br />
	If you set your pastes to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of Pastebin a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the Pastebin Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on Pastebin as permitted through Pastebin's functionality (for example, through cloning). 
	<br /><br />
	<b>6. Moral Rights</b>
	<br />
	You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.
	<br /><br />
	To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant Pastebin the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.
</div>
<div class="content_sub_title">E. Private Pastes</div>
<div class="content_text">
	<div id="notice"><b>Short version:</b> <i>You may have access to private pastes. We treat the content of private pastes as confidential, and we only access it for support reasons, with your consent, or if required to for security reasons.</i></div>
	<b>1. Control of Private pastes.</b>
	<br />
	Some accounts, such as paid accounts, may have private pastes, which allow the User to control access to Content.
	<br /><br />
	<b>2. Confidentiality of Private pastes.</b>
	<br />
	Pastebin considers the contents of private pastes to be confidential to you. Pastebin will protect the contents of private pastes from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.
	<br /><br />
	<b>3. Access.</b>
	<br />
	Pastebin employees may only access the content of your private pastes in the following situations:
	<br /><br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#9654;</b> With your consent and knowledge, for support reasons. If Pastebin accesses a private paste for support reasons, we will only do so with the owner’s consent and knowledge.
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#9654;</b> When access is required for security reasons.
	<br />
	You may choose to enable additional access to your private pastes. For example:
	<br /><br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#9654;</b> You may enable various Pastebin services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private pastes. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but Pastebin will continue to treat your private paste Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the Pastebin Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.
	<br />
	You may also grant a third-party application authorization to use, access, and disclose the contents of your private pastes. Your use of third-party applications is at your sole risk; Pastebin is not liable for disclosures to third parties that you authorize to access a private paste.
	<br /><br />
	<b>4. Exclusions.</b>
	<br />
	If we have reason to believe the contents of a private paste are in violation of the law or of these Terms, we have the right to access, review, and remove them. Additionally, we may be compelled by law to disclose the contents of your private pastes.
</div>
<div class="content_sub_title">F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy</div>
<div class="content_text">If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our <a href="dmca.html">Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy</a>. If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on Pastebin violates your rights, please contact us via our convenient <a href="dmca.html">DMCA form</a> or by emailing admin@pastebin.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.
	<br /><br />
	We will terminate the accounts of repeat infringers of this policy.
</div>
<div class="content_sub_title">G. API Terms</div>
<div class="content_text">Abuse or excessively frequent requests to Pastebin via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access to the API. Pastebin, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.
	<br /><br />
	You may not share API tokens to exceed Pastebin's rate limitations.
	<br /><br />
	You may not use the API to download data or Content from Pastebin for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling Pastebin users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.
	<br /><br />
	All use of the Pastebin API is subject to these Terms of Service and the Pastebin <a href="doc_privacy_statement.html">Privacy Statement</a>.
	<br /><br />
	Pastebin may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of Pastebin's Service.
</div>
<div class="content_sub_title">H. Payment</div>
